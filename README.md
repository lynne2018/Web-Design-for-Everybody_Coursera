                    6. Prior to HTML5 it was a given that each page should have at most one h1 heading. However, when HTML5 introduced the
                    many semantic container elements (section, article, main, aside, ...) the role of the h1changed. The article linked

                    your page, as well as enhance <br>accessibility:
